# Review 4 - For loops

NOTE! Pay close attention to creating code with good and consistent code style.

Use the variable "i" for all your loops. That variable should *not* be accessible outside the loop. Always use a for loop.

1. Make a loop that prints the numbers from 0 to 10.
2. Make a loop that prints the numbers from 10 to 20.
3. Make a loop that prints the numbers from -10 to 10.
4. Make a loop that prints the numbers from 10 to -10.
5. Make a string. Then, make a loop that prints all the individual characters of that string.
6. Make an array with 5 items. Then, make a loop that prints all the individual items of that array.
7. Make an array with 6 items. Then, make a loop that prints every second item of that array.
8. Make an array with 6 items. Then, make a loop that prints every third item of that array.
9. Make an array with 10 items. Then, make a loop that prints every third item of that array starting from the 2nd.
10. Make an array with 7 objects. Each objects should have a property called counter. Create a loop that prints only the counter value of each object.
11. Save a random whole number between 0 and 100 to a variable. Then print all numbers from 0 to 100 and as soon as you reach the random number you created, stop your loop.
